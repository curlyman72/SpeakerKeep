## 🎯 Problem

Modern soundbars and Bluetooth speakers include aggressive power-saving features that automatically put the device into standby mode after 15–20 minutes of "silence." This is problematic when:

- Watching movies with quiet dialogue scenes
- Listening to ambient music or white noise
- Using your computer for work with intermittent audio
- Playing games with silent exploration segments

The result: Your audio cuts out unexpectedly, requiring you to manually wake your speaker with a remote or button press.

---

## 💡 Solution

SpeakerKeep generates inaudible ultrasonic tones (default: 20 kHz) at regular intervals to trick your speakers into thinking audio is constantly playing. This prevents the auto-standby timer from reaching its threshold.

### Why 20 kHz?

- **Above human hearing range** (adult hearing typically tops out at 15–17 kHz)
- **Passes through most audio chains** including Bluetooth, optical, and HDMI
- **Typically inaudible to pets** at normal playback volumes
- **Energy efficient** — short bursts every few minutes use minimal CPU and battery

## 🎮 Usage

### Quick Start

1. Click the **SpeakerKeep** icon in your Chrome toolbar  
2. Select your preferred **frequency** (20 kHz recommended)  
3. Adjust **interval** and **duration** if needed  
4. Click **Start Keep-Alive**  
5. Close the popup — it runs in the background  

### Test Your Setup

Before relying on the keep-alive:

1. Select **1 kHz (Test)**  
2. Click **Test Signal** — you should hear a beep  
3. If you hear it, your speaker is receiving the signal  
4. Switch back to **20 kHz (Stealth)** and start  

### Interface Overview

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Status Dot** | Green pulsing = active, Red = inactive |
| **Countdown** | Time until next keep-alive signal |
| **Visualizer** | Animated bars when tone is playing |
| **Stats** | Current frequency, duration, and interval |

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Frequency Strategy

| Frequency | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|
| **20 kHz** | Default. Inaudible to most humans. |
| **19 kHz** | If 20 kHz is filtered by your audio chain |
| **1 kHz** | Test only (audible verification) |
| **100 Hz** | Sub-bass emphasis |
| **50 Hz** | Mid-bass (may be audible on large speakers) |
| **30 Hz** | Deep low-end (often filtered by small speakers) |

### Recommended Settings

| Scenario | Frequency | Interval | Duration |
|----------|-----------|----------|----------|
| General use | 20 kHz | 4 min | 200 ms |
| Aggressive standby | 20 kHz | 2 min | 300 ms |
| Bluetooth speakers | 20 kHz | 3 min | 200 ms |
| Soundbars (optical) | 20 kHz | 4 min | 200 ms |
| Testing | 1 kHz | 1 min | 500 ms |

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Extension stops working after a while

- Ensure Chrome is updated
- Avoid excessive clearing of browser data
- Verify extension is allowed to run in the background

### Timer shows "NaN" or resets

- Close and reopen the popup
- Toggle the extension off and on
- Check the browser console for errors

### No sound during test

- Verify speaker is connected and powered on
- Check system volume
- Try a different frequency

### 20 kHz doesn't prevent standby

- Try **19 kHz**
- Try **100 Hz**
- Increase duration to 500–1000 ms

### "Extension may have been corrupted"

- Go to `chrome://extensions/`
- Click **Repair**
- Or reload the extension

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Architecture

    Popup["Popup (UI)"]
    Worker["Service Worker (Manifest V3)"]
    Offscreen["Offscreen Document"]
    ChromeAPI["Chrome Extension APIs<br/>- alarms<br/>- storage<br/>- runtime"]

    Popup <--> Worker
    Worker <--> Offscreen
    Worker --> ChromeAPI
```

### How It Works

1. Service Worker maintains state and schedules alarms using `chrome.alarms`
2. Heartbeat every 20 seconds prevents termination
3. Offscreen Document handles Web Audio API playback (Manifest V3 requirement)
4. `OscillatorNode` generates sine wave tones
5. State persists via `chrome.storage`
